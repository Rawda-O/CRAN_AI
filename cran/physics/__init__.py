"""Physics layer (communication-theoretic core).

This layer is the backbone of the framework:
- Channel generation (multiple models)
- Perfect/imperfect CSI handling (robust pairing contribution)
- DF/CF achievable rate expressions
- QoS constraint computation
- Safety post-processing (new contribution: QoS guarantee at inference)
- Hardware impairment hooks (new contribution: residual SI realism)
